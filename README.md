* DESCRIPTION*:
         In this task, I developed a multithreaded client-server chat application using Java sockets, which gave me valuable insight into how network communication and concurrency work in real-time systems. The main goal of this project was to create a functional chat system where multiple users (clients) can communicate simultaneously by connecting to a common server. By working on this project, I learned how socket programming allows two systems to establish a reliable connection over a network using the TCP/IP protocol. I understood how a server socket listens for client connections using the ServerSocket class and how each client is accepted via the Socket class. One of the key aspects of this project was implementing multithreading, which I used to handle multiple client connections simultaneously without blocking the server. This helped me explore Java's Thread class and Runnable interface, giving me hands-on experience with parallel programming and resource sharing. I learned how to manage input and output streams, particularly BufferedReader and PrintWriter, to send and receive text messages in real time. Additionally, I realized the importance of synchronizing shared resources—in this case, the list of active clients—to avoid data inconsistency. The concept of broadcasting messages to all connected users, except the sender, taught me how to loop through active client handler threads and manage message delivery. I also learned how to handle client disconnections gracefully and how to maintain a clean server state by removing inactive clients. Running the server and multiple client instances in Eclipse taught me how to debug multithreaded applications, monitor terminal output, and interpret socket connection logs. Overall, this project enhanced my understanding of low-level networking concepts such as ports, IP addressing, data transmission, and socket lifecycle (connection, communication, and disconnection). Moreover, it improved my Java programming skills, particularly in areas like exception handling, thread management, object-oriented design, and input/output stream handling. This task also made me realize the challenges of building scalable and responsive applications and how to structure code efficiently using classes and methods. It was a great learning experience in both software design and problem-solving, as I had to think critically about how to keep the application stable, responsive, and error-free. This hands-on project bridged the gap between theoretical networking concepts and practical software implementation. Overall, the experience of building a multithreaded chat application strengthened my confidence in Java, network programming, and real-time communication systems, and I now feel more prepared to take on advanced software development tasks in a professional setting.
